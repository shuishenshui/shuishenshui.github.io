									<h3> Professional Experience</h3>
									<p>
										I learned physics for 4 years in Nanjing University, China. I mainly worked on computational physics.
										Driven by curiosity of AI and desire to handle more powerful tools and broaden my mind, I
										began studying Machine Learning at Télécom ParisTech and did many works individually or in group.

												<h4>Lower Complexity Strategy for Monte Carlo Methods</h4>
											<p>Try to find a better sampler in order to solve the Curse of Dimensionality in
												Monte-Carlo methods.<br/>
												I have derived the Adaptive Importance Sampling Algorithm in Gaussian sampler case. Now I’m studying its convergence in Bayesian Logit Model through simulations and theoretical calculations. This work brings me a thorough understanding of Monte Carlo Methods and might be applied to my future research.

												<h4>Acoustic Scene Classification</h4>
											<p>Classify the scenes in which the acoustic file had been recorded<br/>
												I put forward a new preprocessing and training method.
												By analyzing several acoustic files, I found some could be recognized by a small part of sound such as people talking, while others were decided by continuous sound such as sea waves. Thus, I thought the features should be separated into percussive and harmonic parts and be trained separately. My method turned out to increase the performance of various trainers. I was greatly encouraged by this success because we can have particular applications rooting in an explicable intuitional idea.

												<h4>Simulation of Dynamic Self-Assembly of Dipolar Colloids in Alternating Electric Field</h4>
											<p>
												Inspired by the self-assembly of molecules under magnetic fields, I simulated the two-dimensional system of dipolar colloids under electric fields. In a constant temperature solution, my model considered electric force from an external field, Van der Waals force, the electric force between dipole balls, and soft ball collision. My work began with understanding the code examples of LAMMPS and relating them to physics. Based on the open sources I designed my system and through SSH I manipulated our computer cluster to process the simulations in bulk. I worked out a phase diagram which shows the phase transition between static networks, rings and lines structures, and disorder according to the frequency of electric field and colloids density. I also discovered a semi-static structure which potentially offered a new type of material.

													sparse data matrix where each component accords to the score of a film given by a user, into two
													matrices to extract the features of a film. Then the movies predicted to have high score
													would be recommended to a particular user.</p>

												<h4>A Phenomenological Model in Heat Engine</h4>
												<p>
													This work began with the disagreement of Carnot’s law which we were expected to verify in the practical course and the outcome of the experiment. In this experiment, we used the heat engine where air transferred quickly between high and low temperature zones and did work through a piston. Carnot’s Rule had a poor linear relation because the process could not be inversed. We made a model to describe this process whereby the air only absorbed heat from the high temperature zone. Then, using Newton’s law of cooling we derived a linear relation between the inverse of work in one cycle and the velocity-temperature difference ratio. Through doing experiments under different temperatures and changing the work output by fractional torques, we verified the relationship.
