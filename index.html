									<h3> Professional Experience</h3>
									<p>
										I learned physics for 4 years in Nanjing University, China. I mainly worked on computational physics.
										Driven by curiosity of AI and desire to handle more powerful tools and broaden my mind, I
										began studying Machine Learning at Télécom ParisTech and did many works individually or in group.
										Currently I am doing an internship at Inria Sophia Antipolis, using motif discovery methods and co-clustering method
										to find out the similarity and difference of data and improve the PDE model.

												<h4>Big Data Analysis and Traffic Models</h4>
											<p>We transfered the 20G raw data collected by the detectors along highways in Marseille region into time series 
												of speed and flow. Then I applied the motif discovery method (by UCR) to find out patterns. I also used 
												the co-clustering method (by Charles Bouveyron, Inria) to get different clusters of date and location, 
												and calculate the corresponding parameters for LWR traffic model. Now we are doing the simulation discretized 
												by the Godunov Scheme. We expect to have a more precise model than traditional ones, which can give a better prediction 
												of traffic conditions in future.

												<h4>Optimization for Monte Carlo Methods</h4>
											<p>Try to find a better sampler in order to solve the Curse of Dimensionality in
												Monte-Carlo methods.<br/>
												I derived an Average Adaptive Importance Sampling Algorithm and verified its better convergence in Bayesian Logit Model through simulations and theoretical calculations.

												<h4>Acoustic Scene Classification</h4>
											<p>Classify the scenes in which the acoustic file had been recorded<br/>
												I put forward a new preprocessing and training method.
												By analyzing several acoustic files, I found some could be recognized by a small part of sound such as people talking, while others were decided by continuous sound such as sea waves. Thus, I thought the features should be separated into percussive and harmonic parts and be trained separately. My method turned out to increase the performance of various trainers. I was greatly encouraged by this success because we can have particular applications rooting in an explicable intuitional idea.

												<h4>Simulation of Dynamic Self-Assembly of Dipolar Colloids in Alternating Electric Field</h4>
											<p>
												Inspired by the self-assembly of molecules under magnetic fields, I simulated the two-dimensional system of dipolar colloids under electric fields. In a constant temperature solution, my model considered electric force from an external field, Van der Waals force, the electric force between dipole balls, and soft ball collision. My work began with understanding the code examples of LAMMPS and relating them to physics. Based on the open sources I designed my system and through SSH I manipulated our computer cluster to process the simulations in bulk. I worked out a phase diagram which shows the phase transition between static networks, rings and lines structures, and disorder according to the frequency of electric field and colloids density. I also discovered a semi-static structure which potentially offered a new type of material.

													would be recommended to a particular user.</p>

												<h4>A Phenomenological Model in Heat Engine</h4>
												<p>
													This work began with the disagreement of Carnot’s law which we were expected to verify in the practical course and the outcome of the experiment. In this experiment, we used the heat engine where air transferred quickly between high and low temperature zones and did work through a piston. Carnot’s Rule had a poor linear relation because the process could not be inversed. We made a model to describe this process whereby the air only absorbed heat from the high temperature zone. Then, using Newton’s law of cooling we derived a linear relation between the inverse of work in one cycle and the velocity-temperature difference ratio. Through doing experiments under different temperatures and changing the work output by fractional torques, we verified the relationship.
